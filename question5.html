              None. And whenever personnel privacy is involed, graphic tabulation of 
              such assertions, by agency, should be publicly available so that the

              often.

              As noted in my response to Question 4, I believe it is appropriate to restrict access to data
              that could pose risks to public safety or homeland security. Those determinations will have
